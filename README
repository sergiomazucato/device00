The target of this project is to build a device able to handle the following procedures:
- print text over led matrixes displays (up to N matrixes)
- communicate over wifi with similar devices
- send and receive specific messages
- execute interruptions when a button is pushed

The core hardware is an ESP32 and the circuit is build with transistor arrays (pnp and npn), led matrixes (common anode),
shift registers (74HC592) and a push button.

The code presented here was entirely developed, no third refereces besides the common libraries.

The circuit presented was designed with Eagle (freeware) and the sketches can be used when the source is mentioned.

The case is a 3D printed shape, the sources were also developed and can be used when the source is mentioned.

Please feel free to comment or change.
